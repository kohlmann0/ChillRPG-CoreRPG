## What this is: ##

This is a custom rule-set for the _Fantasy Grounds Virtual TableTop_ program.

The rule-set itself, for now, is only a custom character sheet, and a custom dice roller. Most other features have been stripped out.

The ChillRPG ruleset is a mixture of Skill and Attribute based, Roll-Under mechanics, special bonuses on doubles or half-above/below your target.

#### For example: ####
You might have a **Stamina** _attribute_ set at 20, a **Close-Quarters combat** _skill_ at 30, and a basic **Boxing** specialization for another 15. Add them together, and your target number would be 65.

When you roll your 100-sided die, your goal would be to roll under 65 for a success. 
* Lets say you rolled a 55 - Doubles are considered "critical" so a roll of 11, 22, 33, 44, or 55 would cause a "Critical Success".
* If you rolled a 30, that is less than half of your target, so would only be a basic success (but still a succes, congratulations!)
* If you rolled a 40, that's over half, and would be a "High Success", with some minor bonus.
* And finally if you rolled over your target, that is a failure.
* You could also critically fail in this case, by rolling a 66, 77, 88, or 99.

## To use this rule-set: ##

Copy this _entire_ directory to the users Roaming Data folder related to Fantasy Grounds. The default location is C:\Users\\\<your user name\>\\AppData\Roaming\SmiteWorks\Fantasy Grounds\rulesets

The next time you load Fantasy Grounds VTT , it should shown up as "ChillRPG - Based on the CoreRPG Ruleset" as a ruleset option when you start a new campaign.


## Navigating the UI: ##
If you are not familiar with the basic Fantasy Grounds VTT interface, please see their guides here: <https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/QuickStartGuide.php>

For this ruleset specifically, the biggest change is the character sheet, and dice rolling. In this case, the Attributes and Skill names are already pre-loaded. Just set the value by clicking on the number in front of it and start typing.

To roll the dice, simply double click the number in from of the skill or specialization you want to roll.
